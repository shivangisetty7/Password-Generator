# Password-Generator
# 🔐 Password Generator & Strength Checker (Python)

A simple yet useful **cybersecurity-focused Python project** that generates secure random passwords based on user preferences and evaluates their strength. Created as part of my learning journey in **Python** and **Cybersecurity fundamentals**.


##  Why This Project Matters

Weak and predictable passwords are one of the most common causes of data breaches and account hacking.  
This tool helps users:
- Create strong passwords with custom settings
- Understand password strength & security level
- Promote safe password practices

It demonstrates key security concepts like randomness, complexity, and entropy in a beginner-friendly way.


##  Features

✔ Generate strong random passwords  
✔ Customizable settings:
- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Numbers
- Symbols

✔ Password strength rating:
- **Weak**
